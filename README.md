# Stock-Price-trend-Analysis
Stock Price Trend Analysis
Overview
This project analyzes historical stock price data for five major companies (Apple, JPMorgan Chase, Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla) to identify price trends and volatility patterns. Using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib), the analysis includes visualizations of 30-day moving averages and daily returns, supporting data-driven financial insights. The project is developed in a Jupyter Notebook and leverages data from Yahoo Finance via the yfinance library. (In Progress, Expected Completion: August 2025)
Objectives

Analyze stock price trends for five companies using Pandas for data processing.
Visualize price movements and volatility with Matplotlib line and bar plots.
Apply statistical techniques (e.g., correlation analysis) to uncover market relationships.

Tools and Technologies

Python: Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib for visualization
yfinance: API for retrieving stock data
Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment for analysis
Data Source: Yahoo Finance (historical daily prices, 2024–2025)
